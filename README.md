This started as a passion project for me in order to learn React. I ended up learning way more in the process than I couldhave ever imagined.
This is built on a MERN stack MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs. But I use many more technologies and libraries. It is done using functional components.
It is fully responsive and mobile friendly as well as cross platform play. My only two regrets were not taking advantage of Bootstraps built in functionality more
and not doing it in Typescript for the practice. Here is a rundown of what I use:
AWS
EC2 (to host my Ubuntu distro)
S3 Bucket (to store discord user drawings)
Ubuntu 20.04
nginx (my web server and proxy pass for my api and sockets)
certbot (for creating my SSL certs)
socket.io (for my websockets. Bless them and their amazing documentation)
mongoose (for my ORM)
securels (so I didn't need to have sessions or cookies as I store basic info - just secure enugh to not play as other players)
axios (I know fetch is built into the mdn now but I just love axios so much more)
uuid (to keep rooms unique and games/drawings unique across playthroughs)
bootstrap (because who doesn't love bootstrap. though in hindsight I should have utilized it a bit more)
